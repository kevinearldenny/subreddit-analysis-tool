# Subreddit Analysis - PostGRESQL queries

This folder contains a number of SQL queries generated for analyzing data ingested into the DB.

I was initially asked to create 4 SQL queries that used window functions, and these can be seen in the 'window' folder. Validation queries are useful in spotting anomalies // missing data in the DB, and there are a few additional queries that I thought produced some interesting insights in the `general` folder.
